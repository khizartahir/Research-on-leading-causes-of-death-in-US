    "## A. Introduction\n",
    "Data Management is the practice of acquiring, cleaning, manipulating, storing, and analysing data. With the amount of data available to us, it is impossible to just look at raw sheets and tables and be able to make sense out of it. Luckily for us, there are several tools and packages available that make such management doable. \n",
    "One such package in Python is Pandas. Pandas is a software library widely used for Data Manipulation and Analysis. It offers data structures and methods for dealing with datasets. This assignment is an illustration of how effective Pandas are for managing datasets and acquiring the insights otherwise not visible. "

    "## B. Project Overview\n",
    "In this project, we are going to use data related to causes of death in the United States to answer some analytical questions. \n",
    "We have been provided with two datasets:\n",
    "<ol> \n",
    "    <li>The first one has unordered data from year 1999 to year 2016 showing how many deaths were caused by a particular cause of death in a particular state in a particular year.</li>\n",
    "    <li>The second one has population data for the individual states, the four census regions, and United States as a whole for the years 2010 till 2018.</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "We will use these datasets, and Pandas to answer questions about changes in death rate, and identify and analyse the leading causes of death, state-wise, nationally, and yearly. "

By working through the two datasets, we generated insights as to whether the death rate is increasing or decreasing, what are the leading causes of death nationwide, how similar are the leading causes of death in individual states compared to national, and finally, what changes are observed in these leading causes year by year. Pandas allowed us to answer broad questions statiscally. "
